# SmalltalkSurvey
The goal is to compile a reasonably complete list of all implementations of the Smalltalk system.

A language will be considered to be a Smalltalk (1) if it is easy to type in an example from a Smalltalk-80 book while adapting it on the fly (not counting any differences in the libraries) or (2) if "smalltalk" is part of the project's name.
